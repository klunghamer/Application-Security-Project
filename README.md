# Application Security Project

This app is run using Python3 v3.7.0, Node.js v9.11.1, and MongoDB.

Install required dependencies:

```
pip3 install autocorrect
```

```
npm install
```

**To get started:**

Run MongoDB local in the terminal

```
mongod
```

Start the Node server

```
nodemon server.js
```

Now the app can be seen hosted on http:localhost:4000

**User functionality:**

Users can sign up for an account, login/logout, and upload a file to spellcheck, which will then be processed and downloaded on to the users machine.

**Security Considerations:**
Secure web application implementation can be seen [here](Assignment 2.pdf).
